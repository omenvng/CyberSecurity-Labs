### Introduction

In this course we will do a sequence of labs, the end goal of which is to develop a Security Benchmarking Tool (SBT).
These labs will familiarize us with instruments used in IT security departments of different companies as well as give
us practical experience in developing them. Concretely, we will be working with cyber security audit policies -
benchmarks that allow a security officer to assess a system’s vulnerability to different attacks and enforce certain
security configurations based on community best practices.

### Laboratory Tasks

Our desktop application must enable the user to:

* Select the settings to be enforced (a subset of Failed, or all of them);
* Enforce the policy on at least 5 settings (edit the selected settings in your system);
* Rollback to the system’s initial settings.


### Technologies

In this laboratory work I have used Python as a programming language and its standard GUI (Graphical User Interface)
package *Tkinter*. As integrated development environment (IDE) I used Visual Studio Code.

### Setup

Run the application through lab4.py file.
